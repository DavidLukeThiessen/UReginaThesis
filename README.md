This is a template for using RStudio and RMarkdown to write a graduate thesis for the Mathematics and Statistics Department at the University of Regina. It requires RStudio, a latex installation connected to RStudio, the bookdown package, and probably other configurations I've forgotten. To render the file run the command in the "compile.R" script. This will create a "thesis.pdf" file in a "_book" subfolder.
